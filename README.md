# Third Person Example with Cubes

This example demonstrates a simple interaction scenario in a third-person game setup involving cubes.

1. **Spawn Cubes**: Initially, spawn 5 cubes around a central cube manager actor.
2. **Jump Sequence**: After spawning, all cubes perform a simultaneous jump, approximately 1 meter high.
3. **Player Movement**: Once all cubes have jumped, the player is allowed to move freely within the game environment.
4. **Cube Interaction**: When the player touches any of the cubes, that cube is immediately destroyed.
